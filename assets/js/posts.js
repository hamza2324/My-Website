                             "question":  "What is Seedance 2.0?",
                             "answer":  "Seedance 2.0 is an AI video generation model developed by ByteDance, released in early February 2026. It generates cinematic video clips up to 15 seconds long from text, images, video, and audio inputs, at native 2K resolution with synchronized audio."

                             "answer":  "Yes. Free credits are available on signup through Jianying.com (currently requires a Chinese Douyin account). Global access via CapCut is coming. Third-party platforms offering Seedance model access are also available now."

                             "answer":  "Within days of launch, viral videos showed realistic AI-generated scenes featuring Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Disney characters, and Paramount IP. The Motion Picture Association, Disney, Paramount, and SAG-AFTRA all condemned the tool for copyright infringement. ByteDance responded by promising stronger safeguards."

                             "answer":  "Seedance 2.0 offers higher resolution (2K vs 1080p), more comprehensive native audio generation, and a more flexible reference system. Sora 2 offers longer maximum clip length (20s vs 15s) and has an available API. For most short-form content creation, Seedance 2.0 currently produces better-looking output."
