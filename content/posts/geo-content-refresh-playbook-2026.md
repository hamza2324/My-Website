# GEO Content Refresh Playbook 2026: Update Old Posts to Win AI Search Traffic

Refreshing high-potential posts is often faster than publishing from zero.

## Why refresh can outperform net-new publishing

Existing URLs already have crawl history, link context, and behavioral data.

## Step 1: choose refresh targets by business intent

Prioritize pages with rising impressions but weak CTR, or stable traffic with low conversion.

## Step 2: rewrite intros for answer-first retrieval

Start with direct answers in 2-4 sentences so AI systems can extract high-confidence blocks.

## Step 3: rebuild heading architecture

Structure around diagnosis, implementation, common mistakes, checklist, and FAQ.

## Step 4: refresh evidence and dates

Update numbers, timelines, and claims to maintain trust and relevance.

## Step 5: strengthen internal linking by intent flow

Map links from awareness to implementation to troubleshooting to conversion pages.

## Step 6: add schema-ready FAQ content

Keep answers concise, specific, and visible on page.

## Step 7: optimize conversion paths

Match CTA type to user intent stage.
