# Why this workflow matters

Most teams waste hours each week compiling updates from multiple tools. AI can reduce this to a repeatable 10-minute process.

## What you need

- A source of metrics (spreadsheet, CRM, or analytics export)
- A prompt template for summarization
- A simple review checklist before sending

## Step-by-step

1. Export your weekly metrics in CSV format.
2. Feed structured data into your AI prompt.
3. Ask the model for summary + anomalies + next actions.
4. Review the output and send to your team.

## Prompt template

```text
You are an operations analyst. Summarize this week\'s metrics in 5 bullet points,
identify anomalies, and propose 3 actions for next week.
```

## Final notes

Start with one team report and optimize your prompt every week.
